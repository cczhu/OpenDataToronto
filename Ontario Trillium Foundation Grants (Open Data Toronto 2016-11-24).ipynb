    "\n",
    "The [Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF)](http://www.otf.ca/) is an agency of the Ontario provincial government that allocates more than $136 million annually in social/community program funding annually province-wide.  Applications are submitted (largely) [online](http://www.otf.ca/apply-grant) and are [judged](http://www.otf.ca/how-we-work/lifecycle-grant) by panels composed of OTF staff and local volunteers before being forwarded to the Board of Directors for final approval.  Once approved, a project is monitored on a semiannual to annual basis.  Upon successful completion of the project, a final report is submitted to release any remaining funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple types of investment, or [\"streams\"](http://www.otf.ca/what-we-fund/investment-streams).  As of fiscal year (FY) 2015, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seed Grants**: for studies, trials or conferences and discussion panels to investigate new concepts. \\$5,000 - 75,000, up to 1 year.\n",
    "* **Grow Grants**: for replicating, adapting or scaling a proven model, or piloting and demonstrating a tested model.  \\$50,000 - 250,000 per year, for 2 to 3 years.\n",
    "* **Capital Grants**: for purchasing, upgrading or renovating infrastructure.  \\$5,000 - 150,000, up to 1 year.\n",
    "* **Collective Impact Grants**: for a multilateral initiative by multiple actors and agencies to tackle a broader issue.  Up to \\$500,000 per year, for up to 5 years, though funding will vary depending on the [stage of the initiative](http://www.otf.ca/what-we-fund/investment-streams/collective-impact-grants).\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications are evaluated in accordance with what OTF believes will improve the quality of life of Ontarians, as measured by the [Canadian Index for Wellbeing (CIW)](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/).  As of FY 2015, OTF focuses on six [\"Action Areas\"](http://www.otf.ca/what-we-fund/action-areas) and their [corresponding CIW measurements](http://www.otf.ca/how-we-work/canadian-index-wellbeing): Active People (providing physical activity spaces and opportunities), Connected People (improving community connectivity and civil participation), Green People (environmentally sensitive and sustainable living), Inspired People (culture and the arts), Promising Young People (fostering and empowerment of youth) and Prosperous People (economic security).  OTF grants up to FY 2014 were divided into four categories (as described in, eg., [OTF's 2014 annual report, pg. 13 - 15](http://www.otf.ca/sites/default/files/annual_report_13-14.pdf)): human and social services, arts and culture, sports and recreation, and the environment.  As most OTF grants are based on the older categories, our analysis uses those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual OTF-funded projects are evaluated based on whether they contribute to [grant result goals](http://www.otf.ca/sites/default/files/investment_strategy2.pdf), such as certifying coaches and volunteers for physical activity programs, or allowing youths facing barriers to reach leadership positions.  On a 3 - 5 year basis, aggregate OTF results are measured against priority outcomes, such as high quality physical activity programs, and more youths that are meaningfully engaged with the community.  On a 10 year basis, OTF's actions are compared against the CIW indicators discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on OTF policies, see [here](http://www.otf-policies.ca/policies--english-.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>The OTF Open Data Directory</h2>\n",

    "In accordance with the Ontario government's Open Data Directive, OTF provides data on grant applications, summaries of the grant review process, and corporate expenses on their [open data page](http://www.otf.ca/open).  A full listing of data provided can be found in [this document](http://www.otf.ca/sites/default/files/otf_data_inventory_en.xlsx)."

    "Plotting the real value (inflation-adjusted) funding (solid black line) in the upper-left subplot of the figure below, we find that, other than blips around the year 2001 and 2011, funds have almost kept up with inflation (there is a very slight downward slope).  (The dashed black line is the total funding unadjusted for inflation.)  Interestingly, the total amount of money requested by applicants has gone down over the years, which can be more easily seen in the bottom-left subplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down the funding by sector (top-right figure), we see that health and social services comprise about 50% of all funding, with sports and arts taking about 20% each, and the environment about 10%.  There's a spike in healthcare spending in 2011 alongside corresponding dips in environmental and sports funding, indicating the 2011 spike is healthcare related (we'll look at that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the fraction of granted to requested funding (bottom-left), no systematic bias for underfunding proposed projects in any sector is obvious.  As discussed before, successful applications tend to have been granted 30% less money than asked for back in the early 2000, which is no longer the case in recent years."

Both median and mean funding have increased with time, which, given the declining number of total grants per year above, means that fewer projects are receiving the same amount of money.  Mean funding is typically a factor of 1.6 larger than median funding, indicative of the non-Gaussian distribution of funds per grant.\n",

This makes sense, since the systematic and infrastructure changes needed are larger for those two than for arts and sports.  Also, there is no spike in 2011 in median health funding, but there is in mean health funding, betraying a single large health-related project being funded that year."
